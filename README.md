# Cotton_growth_variation
This is the code related to our paper 'Quantify growth variation in cotton due to different soil texture and weather conditions using UAV imagery' authored by Aijing Feng, Jianfeng Zhou, Earl Vories and Kenneth Sudduth.

This study aimed to develop deep learning models for predicting cotton yield of different years using imagery data and environment (soil and weather condition). The novelty of this study is to develop a method for predicting crop yield of future years based the interaction of environment and management. Deep learning models were used to fuse data of different types and different resolution. Yield prediction models based on deep learning were able to predict yield at good accuracy.
